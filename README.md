# Grafana Installation and Dashboard Creation for Ubuntu Server Performance
## Introduction
In this lab, we set up Grafana to interface with Azure Monitor using Managed Identity for authentication. Instead of using traditional client secrets or credentials, we used Azure Managed Identity, which provides secure, automated authentication without retaining sensitive data. This method improved security while simplifying access control. We configured an Azure Monitor data source in Grafana, authenticated with Managed Identity, and ran a health check to ensure the connection. In addition, we resolved frequent difficulties such as subscription access and missing Log Analytics workspaces, guaranteeing a seamless combination of Grafana with Azure Monitor for efficient cloud monitoring.
